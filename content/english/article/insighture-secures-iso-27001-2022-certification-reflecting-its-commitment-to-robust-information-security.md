Insighture proudly announces its latest achievement – the successful attainment of the ISO 27001:2022 certification by the leading awarding body Euroveritas accredited by BAR-UK (British Accreditation Registrars, UK).

ISO/IEC 27001 is the premier global standard for designing, implementing, and maintaining an Information Security Management System (ISMS). Insighture’s goal with its new ISMS policy is to protect company information assets against threats, ensure business continuity, and minimise the impact of security breaches. The CIA triad, a fundamental principle in information security, stands for securing the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of critical data for business operations. These three core principles guide the company's approach to information security, as reflected in said ISMS policy.

Expressing his excitement about this company milestone, Arun Datta, Co-Founder and Head of Technology and Growth at Insighture, emphasised the significance of this accomplishment, stating, 

> "This is a proud moment signifying our commitment to data security and reinforces Insighture’s position as a trusted technology delivery partner in the APAC region. This certification exemplifies our dedication to maintaining the highest standards of information security, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our clients’ data. We are thrilled to continue providing top-tier services while prioritizing the protection of our clients’ sensitive information."

Such certifications as the ISO 27001:2022 process demand stringent audit and conformity as per third party independent audit. The comprehensive assessment encompasses all aspects of information security, including risk management, access control, incident response, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. It demonstrates the company’s ability to systematically manage sensitive company and customer information, identify potential threats and implement robust controls to mitigate them effectively. 

Thilanga Manjula, Head of Infrastructure Services at Insighture, emphasised the pivotal role of this certification in the company's cybersecurity strategy, stating,

> "Achieving this certification highlights our dedication to robust data security and uninterrupted service. It's not just a badge of honor. It symbolises our commitment to delivering the highest standards of service while embracing continuous improvement in our field. Heartfelt thanks to our team and stakeholders for their invaluable support in this journey."

Insighture is dedicated to compliance, bolstering trust and meeting regulatory standards for both its consultancy and clients. It hopes to further enhance its ISMS to address emerging threats and align with industry best practices, employing a proactive, risk-based approach.

In the upcoming year, the company plans to provide advanced cybersecurity training for employees to better detect and respond to threats, and aims to improve threat detection and remediation processes through automated pipelines. It will also introduce new security technologies and expand compliance protocols to meet regulatory standards. These steps will ensure that Insighture meets the evolving security needs of the industry, reinforcing its dedication to providing top-notch service and protection to stakeholders.
