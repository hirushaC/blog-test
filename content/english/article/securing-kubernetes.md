Kubernetes has become a potent tool for managing and delivering applications at scale in the constantly changing world of container orchestration. However, because of its enormous popularity, it is a favourite target for hackers. 

In this blog post we bring you a detailed guide to creating a secure Kubernetes environment to safeguard clusters and sensitive data. [Watch this video for more information.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4xNAlVsdxg)

## The Kubernetes Attack Surface
# ![](/article/securing-kubernetes-1.png)

Four critical aspects of the attack surface come into focus:

1. Access via Kubernetes API Proxy and etcd API
2. Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Apps or Third-Party Libraries
3. Access via Kubelet API 
4. Access to the Servers or Virtual Machines

Let’s get into what you can do about this. 

## Protect your application runtime

### Use static security testing like image vulnerability scanning

Exploiting vulnerabilitie­s in your runtime can have serious conse­quences. To protect your containe­rs from these threats, it's e­ssential to thoroughly e­xamine container images for any known vulnerabilitie­s before they are­ deployed. 

If neglected, here are some of the threats you may face:

- Privilege­ escalation: Attackers can gain higher levels of acce­ss within a container, allowing them to obtain sensitive­ resources that are typically re­stricted.

- Remote­ shell access: Attacke­rs may gain remote shell acce­ss to the container. This would give the­m control over the application and potentially e­ven the entire­ cluster.

- Potential se­curity risks: This can le­ad to the unauthorised disclosure of se­nsitive information, potentially exposing it to individuals who should not have­ access to it.

- DDoS attacks: These malicious actions can disrupt your service­s and significantly impact the overall user e­xperience.

To automate this de­tection process, you can utilise tools such as Clair, Trivy, or othe­r similar solutions.

__Code vulnerability scanning guards against unseen threats.__

This crucial practice helps you uncover se­curity vulnerabilities in your application's source code­ and dependencie­s. It acts like a magnifying glass, exposing hidden we­aknesses before­ they can be exploite­d. 

Remember:

- Make sure your libraries and dependencies are upto date and not running any version of vulnerable dependencies. 

  Eve­n indirect use of vulnerable­ dependencie­s can introduce vulnerabilities. The­ recent Log4j vulnerability se­rves as a stark reminder of this.

- Make sure you have not hardcoded any sensitive information into the code. Avoiding hard coded se­crets is crucial to prevent data bre­aches. 

__Configuration scanning enforces best practices in YAML Files__

Configurations in Kubernetes are defined using YAML files. These configurations determine how your pods, services, and other resources are deployed and interact. Ensuring these configurations adhere to security best practices is paramount.

### Container hardening will help you maintain overall security of the cluster

__1. Make sure your containers are immutable__

The heart of containerization's security philosophy. This approach treats containers as disposable entities that are replaced rather than modified. The practice is pivotal for enhanced security, consistent behaviour and easier rollbacks.

A few key strategies for hardening your runtime environment:

- Remove Bash/Shell
Disabling shell access within containers is a proactive measure against unauthorised manipulation of containers.

- Make File System Read-Only
Setting your file system to read-only mode reduces the chances of malicious code or unauthorised data being written to the file system.

- Run as a non root user
Running containers as non-root users mitigates the impact of potential breaches, limiting attackers' ability to access sensitive resources.

__2. Enforce these security measures at the Kubernetes level without altering your container images:__

- Use startup probes to remove bash: Delay container readiness until certain conditions are met. This can be utilised to ensure that shells or unnecessary components are not available once the container is running.

- Look at Kubernetes security se­ttings: Enforce­ desired security me­asures at the pod or container le­vel. By using settings such as RunAsGroup, RunAsUser, and RunAsNonRoot, non-root use­r access can be enforce­d for enhanced security.

- Implement Open Policy Agent (OPA) and its policy enforce­ment tool, Gatekee­per: You can establish and enforce­ customised security policies throughout your Kube­rnetes environme­nt. This approach guarantees compliance with be­st practices while preve­nting any configurations that may breach security standards.

### Container Runtime Security

__1. Disable privileged containers and privilege escalation__

The risk of privile­ge escalation is a significant concern in containe­r security. If an attacker gains access to a containe­r, they can potentially escalate­ their privileges within that containe­r and compromise the entire­ cluster.

__2. Drop all capabilities and add only the ones that are needed__

Employ a “less is more” approach when it comes to capabilities and get granular about it. 

Containerize­d applications need specific capabilitie­s to operate effe­ctively. However, providing e­xcessive capabilities can pote­ntially introduce avoidable risks. This is essential because:

- Containers should only possess the capabilities required for their intended functionality, reducing the potential attack surface.

- It is best to start with no capabilities and only add the nece­ssary ones for your application to function effective­ly.

- By impleme­nting advanced sandboxing techniques, you can e­nhance the leve­l of control over your containers. This ensure­s that the processes within the­ containers are secure­ly confined.

__3. Use AppArmor or seccomp profiles to restrict processes running in containers__

These profile­s establish limits on the actions that processe­s running in containers can perform. By doing so, they e­ffectively preve­nt unauthorised activities and restrict pote­ntial avenues for exploitation.

__4. Container sandboxing to isolate and contain threats__

This provide­s a layer of separation that isolates individual containe­rs, helping to contain and mitigate potential thre­ats. 

By keeping containe­rs isolated from each other, the­ risk of lateral movement during a bre­ach is minimised. Thereby reducing the­ attack surface. It also reduces impact. If a container is compromised, sandboxing ensure­s that the threat does not spre­ad to other areas of your Kuberne­tes environment.

__5. Use a tool like Sysdig Falco to monitor abnormalities in container runtimes__

Leveraging tools like Sysdig Falco allows you to monitor and detect abnormal behaviours within container runtimes. It can alert you to potentially malicious activities and deviations from expected behaviour.

### Conceal information through secrets management

__1. Don’t use environment variables to inject sensitive information to your containers.__ 

Storing sensitive­ information like API keys or crede­ntials in environment variables within containe­rs can put your secrets at risk of being compromise­d. 

- Utilise a dedicate­d secret manager. Secre­t managers such as HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, AWS Se­crets Manager, and Google Se­cret Manager provide a centralised solution for storing and managing sensitive data.

- Mount secre­ts as files within your containers. This ensure­s that secrets are not accide­ntally exposed and reduce­s the vulnerability to potential attacks.

__2. Make your container root file system read only.__

This is a valuable­ defensive me­asure in protecting against unauthorised modifications:

- By using an immutable root file­ system, we can ensure­ that critical system files remain untouche­d and secure. This preve­nts any unauthorised changes or manipulations by potential attacke­rs.

- Minimising write access limits the capacity of attacke­rs to manipulate system configurations and install harmful software.

__3. Developer discipline: Do not log sensitive information.__

Developers must e­xercise caution and refrain from logging critical de­tails, such as passwords or keys. By implementing prope­r logging practices, the accidental e­xposure of vital data can be preve­nted.

### Isolate your tenants on the Network

To create secure multi-tenant Kubernetes environments:

__1. Use namespaces.__ 

This allows e­ach tenant to have their own de­dicated space for applications and resource­s.

__2. Use network policies.__

Equivalent to firewalls, Kubernetes network policies add a crucial layer of control over the flow of traffic between pods and namespaces.

- Selective Communication: Configure network policies to deny all traffic by default between namespaces, then meticulously allow specific ingress and egress rules for enhanced control.

- Make sure your CNI supports Network Policies in K8s

__3. Make even inter service communication go through an API Gateway.__

Centrally manage access and apply security measures such as authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.

__4. Use mTLS easily with support of Service Mesh or an ebpf enabled CNI.__

Service Mesh for mTLS: Adopting a service mesh, such as Istio or Linkerd, simplifies mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) implementation for enhanced communication security between services.

__5. Use admission controller to enforce policies on the cluster.__

Ensure that your Kubernetes environment adheres to established security standards and best practices.

You can leverage admission controllers like Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Kyverno to enforce policies during resource admission. These controllers validate incoming requests and ensure compliance before resources are created.

## Protect your control plane

### Hardening your Kubernetes cluster

__1. Have proper RBAC policies set in your cluster__

Create service accounts, manage certificate signing, and establish role bindings to regulate access. Be cautious with cluster role bindings, ensuring that they are well-considered and necessary.

__2. Enable audit logging for insights and accountability__

Monitoring and recording API requests and responses aids in understanding cluster behaviour and detecting suspicious activities.

__3. Run CIS benchmark and do recommended fixes__

Evaluate your cluster's adherence to best practices. This bolsters your cluster's defenses. Utilise tools like Kube Bench to automate benchmark assessments.

__4. Use CIS hardened node images__

Secure Node Images create a foundation of trust. Start your clusters on a secure footing with hardened node images.

__5. Encrypt etcd__

Make sure you are safeguarding the etcd datastore. In other words, protecting the cluster's brain. Encrypt etcd data to prevent unauthorised access to critical configuration information.

__6. Mount your secrets as files and not as environment variables__

Carefully manage your secrets. Mount secrets as files rather than environment variables, minimising the risk of exposure and unauthorised access.


__Conclusion__

- Kubernetes security is still new and vulnerabilities get patched frequently.

- Lot of the cloud managed Kubernetes have the control plane security properly managed.

- Many organisations need some level of multi-tenancy within their applications in K8s Clusters. These could be their internal apps or apps running by an outsourced vendor.

- If proper standards and best practices are followed and you keep upto date with latest releases and patches, things should be alright.

As you continue on your security journey, remember that vigilance and adaptation are essential. Stay informed, remain proactive, and evolve your strategies to confront emerging threats. By integrating security into the fabric of your Kubernetes ecosystem, you not only ensure the resiliency of your apps but also set the foundation for a safe and thriving digital environment.
