At Insighture, our guiding mission is to use technology and innovation to not only address problems that matter in our industry but to also to give back to the communities we serve. Grounded in our principles of humility, collaboration, respect, passion, ownership, and our dedication to creating shared value, our commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) stands at the forefront. 

In this blog post, we're excited to share about an inspiring CSR initiative we've undertaken to improve the educational experience for Sri Lankan students in need. 

> As mentioned in previous blog posts, most of our CSR initiatives is driven by an innate passion for capacity building in the education sector. 

It is a worthy effort in the bigger scheme of the transformation narrative both for technology and the lives of people. After all, Sri Lanka is our primary talent pool for the expert remote tech teams we manage. We are eager to safeguard the youngsters of tomorrow to help them better lead the charge for a brighter future. 

**Nurturing the Next Generation**

One of our most gratifying CSR projects involved providing essential school supplies to a school in Unella. On Thursday the 22nd of December 2020, Insighture furthered its commitment to giving back to the community by supporting the Provincial School in Unella, Matara. 

Recognizing the importance of quality education and ensuring equal opportunities for all students, we donated school supplies such as notebooks, shoes and other required stationary items to the students in preparation for the New Year. 

> Our aim was to alleviate the financial burden on families and inspire young minds to pursue their educational journey with enthusiasm and optimism.

In addition to our commitment to CSR, Insighture recognizes the immense potential of Sri Lanka's IT talent and the rising opportunities in the industry. Through our efforts to identify, nurture, and connect individuals with global opportunities, we aim to unleash this hidden talent onto the world stage. By fostering a supportive ecosystem, providing training and mentorship, and promoting diversity and inclusivity, we believe in creating a thriving IT community in Sri Lanka. 

We hope this blog inspires others to join us in making a difference.
