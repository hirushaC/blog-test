According to the official GPTW employee survey, 96% of our employees reported [Insighture](https://www.insighture.com/) as a Great Place to Work. We are thrilled with this news and look forward to the future. 

[Great Place to Work](https://www.greatplacetowork.com) is the global authority on workplace culture, having surveyed over 100 million employees worldwide. They've harnessed these deep insights to identify the key ingredient that makes a workplace great: trust. With their employee survey platform, leaders gain access to feedback, real-time reporting, and invaluable insights to make informed and strategic decisions that elevate their organisations.

Achieving this certification is an incredible honour that underscores Insighture's unwavering dedication to its people-first culture and the high standards of excellence we uphold in all our endeavours.

At Insighture, we don't just build technology solutions, we want to create an environment where partnerships extend beyond projects, where code knows no boundaries, and where unity thrives amidst diversity. These values are more than just words on our office walls, they are the essence of who we are. The GPTW certification supports us in all of these objectives. 

As we reflect on our journey, one that has led us to a vibrant team that’s 150 strong, we're excited to share how this result came to be. It's through hard work and intentionality that our valued employees echo the below sentiment.

__100% of the GPTW survey responses indicate that Insighture is a caring and welcoming place to work. This is a testament to our commitment to employee well-being and talent growth.__

To witness our efforts translate into the exceptional employee experience we offer today is something which we don’t take for granted. Our founders Charith De Silva and Arun Datta feel this deeply. Their goal is to shape a world-class IT company experience right here in Sri Lanka, an island where so much potential exists for technological growth.

__“Having worked in various regions and cultural environments, we understand that people need the right platforms to lift off and shoot for the stars. Doing this in the remote hybrid space is different. To all organisations out there, put your people first and make it count” - Arun Datta, Director Technology and Growth__

Over the years, we have scaled up and expanded our service capabilities. Along with these success stories and ambitious pursuits, we have had to adapt our culture to ensure that the entire team easily comes onboard with our core values. 

One of those values is that everyone takes pride in the work that they do and feels valued as the company’s greatest asset. With this in mind, we have initiated several programs for talent growth within the company. These programs include tech talk slots directed at youngsters entering the tech industry, tech community events that boost employee visibility, and numerous opportunities for upskilling and leadership i.e. regular feedback loops, mentoring, training workshops, self-study speciality courses and shadowing for interns.

We also understand that employees have lives beyond work. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we realised that many of our people have a certain thirst for self-expression that exists beyond job satisfaction. They also need taking care of due to the high pressures of the job all the while trying to maintain a work life balance, most of them being working parents.

Hence, the actions of our Culture Club have gone a long way to encourage a healthy work-life integration for everyone. The afterwork sports club, game nights, hiking club, webinars on holistic health and company-sponsored counselling sessions are just a few initiatives we’ve established that have made a real difference in the lives of our people. 

Our commitment to creating shared value is at the core of our business philosophy. 

__From our meticulous hiring process to nurturing the entire employee journey, we recognize that the strength of any relationship lies in mutual benefit and understanding.__

Fair compensation, diversity, inclusivity, and an open door policy are among the pillars the company is built on.

In other words, we are ardent advocates of progress and development, seeking improvement not only for our clients but also our people. The bigger picture of ours is to make a difference in the lives of others and we do this by giving back to the wider community we serve with our corporate social responsibility projects which have included donations to the healthcare and education sectors in critical times of need.

We want to give a big shoutout to our awesome People and Culture leaders, the Management team, and everyone who's been part of our leadership, both past and present. Your incredible efforts have played a crucial role in achieving this fantastic GPTW result since day one. And a huge thanks to all our team members for taking the time to support us with the survey and for their dedication day in and day out. 

By keeping teams highly engaged and in alignment with our values, we have been able to deliver consistently in terms of scale, strategy, time and delivery, all of which are factors a cloud-focused business like ours banks on. 

We know that at any point in time, our people play a huge role in contributing to commercial acumen, quality control, ethical considerations and client servicing that goes above and beyond the initial requirement. Our People-First approach is what drives our engineering excellence.
