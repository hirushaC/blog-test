Here at the Insighture, we are driven by a mission to solve complex problems, empower businesses, and make the world a better place through the combined power of technology and human ingenuity. Our commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) is deeply rooted in our core values of humility, collaboration, respect, passion, ownership, and care for both the community and the environment. In this blog post, we are thrilled to share some of the impactful CSR activities we have undertaken, showcasing our dedication to giving back and creating positive change.

**Empowering Tomorrow's Leaders Through Technology**

Our co-founders (Arun Datta and Charith De Silva) undoubtedly believe in the transformative power of education. As a result of it  and as part of our CSR initiative on Saturday the 17th of December 2022, we had the privilege of supporting the Kadugoda Kanishta Vidyalaya in Hanwella where we provided state-of-the-art equipment for their newly established computer lab.

> Through this donation, we aimed to enhance the learning experience and technological access for the students, empowering them with valuable digital skills for a brighter future.

Merely providing equipment is not enough; we believe in empowering students with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the digital landscape. Insighture actively engages with educational institutions to offer tech guidance and training sessions. Our team of experts conducts workshops and training programs, equipping both students and teachers with the necessary knowledge to make the most of the computer lab resources. These sessions cover topics such as basic computer skills, coding, software applications, and internet safety.

Our team also makes sure to provide ongoing support and maintenance services to ensure the computer labs remain fully functional. The OPS team also conducts regular check-ups, troubleshooting any technical issues promptly. We understand the importance of a reliable and seamless learning environment, and we strive to ensure that students and teachers can fully utilize the technology resources at their disposal.
