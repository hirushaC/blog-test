A test automation framework is a collection of best practices, popular
tools, and libraries that help QA testers evaluate the functionality,
security, usability, and accessibility of multiple web and mobile
applications.

It enables the user to efficiently develop, run, and report automation
test scripts. Typically, these frameworks combine guidelines, coding
standards, concepts, processes, practices, project hierarchies,
modularity, reporting mechanisms, test data injections, etc. Users
benefit because they can easily follow the standards while automating
the application. While there are many benefits to using test automation
frameworks, some of the most valuable are ease of scripting,
scalability, modularity, process definition, reusability, and low
maintenance requirements. Typically, developers use one or more
frameworks to maximize these benefits.

When a development team is working on different modules of the same
application, it is important to avoid a mishmash of approaches. This
creates confusion and increases the probability of errors. Instead,
organizations should choose the ideal framework for their specific needs
and apply it to each module. Other benefits of using test automation
frameworks include:

1. Reusability of code
2. Maximum coverage
3. Recovery scenario
4. Low-cost maintenance
5. Minimal manual intervention
6. Easy Reporting

 ![](/article/test-automation-frameworks-and-how-to-use-them-image6.png)

-   When compared with others, cypress is a more developer-centric test
    automation framework and a new standard in front-end testing for
    every developer and QA engineer.

-   It is a complete end-to-end testing experience that is based on Test
    Driven Development.

-   Cypress has its Test runner which can write and run tests locally.

-   Debugging tests is also easy as running tests with built-in
    parallelization and load balancing.

-   It has next-level benefits like record test results, screenshots,
    and video - and view collections insights in cypress.

-   Another advantage is it has real-time reload ability automatically
    reloads whenever you make changes to your tests.

-   Unlike other frameworks, cypress has automatically waited for
    commands and assertions before moving on.

## Webdriver-IO

    your requirements.

## Key points to think about before selecting a Test Automation Framework

When it comes to choosing a test automation framework, surely it might
be a really difficult task as you have so many test automation
frameworks available. It can be overwhelming to choose the one that
works best for testing your application. We have to go through many
considerations to choose the best framework for us. So here we will
explore the initial considerations for choosing a framework.

### Understanding the requirements

To choose the test automation framework that fits the project first, we
should understand the business requirements of the project. There can be
many business requirements but here we will share some of them which
help to choose the test framework. Type of the project: web application,
mobile application, or desktop application. Scope of the project:
Identify the test scenarios for each feature and its dependencies. It
helps to identify the foundation of tests and to spot the foremost vital
areas to test. Understand the capabilities of your team whether the team
is enriched with required strengths. Requirements on how it needs to be
implemented and maintained.

### Identify the main criteria of the project.

Under this, it needs to understand key criteria of the project such as,

-   Ease of development and maintenance

    -   It should be simple, easy to handle, and possible to reduce
        human and time resource utilization.

-   Cross-platform capability

    -   Supports multiple platforms, multiple languages, and multiple
        browsers.

-   Cross-browser capability

    -   Supports multiple browsers.

-   Language

    -   Supporting the different languages to create the custom-built
        scripts would be useful.

-   Pricing

    -   Open source or paid.

-   Type of framework

    -   According to the level of testing: Integration Testing, Unit
        Testing, Functional Testing, and Nonfunctional Testing.

### Identify the pros and cons of each framework.

List down all frameworks with the key criteria's and identify the pros
and cons of each while considering the organizational and business
requirements.

### Analyze the results.

By considering all the above criteria's take a decision with your team
and choose the framework with Maximum coverage, Recovery scenario,
Minimal manual intervention, and Easy reporting.

## Getting Started

The following helpful questions to determine the best framework for your
organization:

1. Consider the application and the technology involved. How was the
    application built? What is the user experience like?
2. Think about testing requirements. Does the application have a very
    complex workflow process?
3. Determine the license cost of the tool. What costs are associated
    with each framework?
4. Evaluate the skill sets available within your organization. What
    skills does your team already have?
5. Is there a team that could plug into one of the frameworks?

When evaluating multiple tools, it is useful to create a dashboard to
evaluate various metrics such as ease of scripting, integration, usage
and generating reports. And will help you choose the right tool for you.

## Conclusion

There are so many open-source test automation frameworks and tools out
there that it is impossible to list them all in one article. These 5
tools catch my eye, but keep in mind that not all tools and frameworks
are created equal. The two areas that these frameworks and tools shine
in are their support for different operating systems and different
scripting languages.

As automation tests become more popular, new challenges and
opportunities arise. For example, AI, Robotic process automation (RPA),
and machine learning are expected to experience significant growth over
the next few years. Therefore, it is wise to consider the benefits and
risks of automation, including test automation frameworks and RPA
solutions, in your company.
